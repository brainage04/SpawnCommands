"""Turn the native capture crop into the shipped square icon (Pillow 12.3.0).

The crop is Minecraft GUI pixel art: every GUI pixel is a BLOCK x BLOCK square of one
colour. This script recovers the native GUI-pixel image by taking each block's majority
colour (ties, which only occur on the faint sky-gradient seams, go to the candidate
colour that is most common in the surrounding 3x3 blocks, then to the smallest RGB
value), enlarges it FACTOR times with NEAREST, centres it on a transparent CANVAS x CANVAS
square and writes ../icon.png. The mod's shipped copies are that icon resized to 128x128
with LANCZOS.

Run from docs/icon/provenance: python3 native_scale.py
